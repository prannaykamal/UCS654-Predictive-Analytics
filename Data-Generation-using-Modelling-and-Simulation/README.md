# Data Generation using Modelling and Simulation for Machine Learning

## 📌 Overview

This project demonstrates how modelling and simulation can be used to generate synthetic datasets for Machine Learning. A simulation environment was explored, relevant parameters were studied, 1000 simulations were generated, and multiple Machine Learning models were trained and compared using evaluation metrics.

The complete implementation was developed using **Python** in **Google Colab**, and the results are available in this repository.

## 🧪 Step 1: Selection of Simulation Tool

After exploring the list of computer simulation software from Wikipedia, multiple tools such as NetLogo, SimPy, ns-3 and OpenFOAM were studied.

**Gymnasium (CartPole-v1)** was selected for this assignment because:

* It is open-source and Python-based
* Easy to install and execute in Google Colab
* Provides a physics-based simulation environment
* Suitable for generating structured numerical data for Machine Learning tasks

Engineering simulators like OpenFOAM and ns-3 were analyzed but avoided due to heavy installation requirements and higher complexity for this assignment.

---

## ⚙️ Step 2: Installation and Exploration

The Gymnasium simulator was installed using pip inside Google Colab.

The CartPole simulation environment provides four important observation parameters:

* Cart Position
* Cart Velocity
* Pole Angle
* Pole Angular Velocity

The action space consists of two actions:

* 0 → Push cart left
* 1 → Push cart right

## 📊 Step 3: Parameter Study

The following lower and upper bounds were used to generate random simulation inputs:

| Parameter     | Lower Bound | Upper Bound |
| ------------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| Cart Position | -4.8        | 4.8         |
| Cart Velocity | -3          | 3           |
| Pole Angle    | -0.418      | 0.418       |
| Pole Velocity | -3          | 3           |

Random values were generated within these bounds to create diverse simulation states.

## 🔁 Step 4 & Step 5: Data Generation using Simulation

A total of **1000 simulations** were executed.

### Methodology

1. Random parameters were generated within defined bounds.
2. The generated state was passed into the CartPole simulator.
3. A random action (0 or 1) was applied.
4. Simulator outputs were recorded.
5. All data was stored in a dataset (`simulation_data.csv`).

### Dataset Features

* cart_position
* cart_velocity
* pole_angle
* pole_velocity
* action
* reward

**Note:** The reward value remained constant during simulation, therefore the Machine Learning task focused on predicting the **action** instead of reward.

## 🤖 Step 6: Machine Learning Model Comparison

### 🎯 Objective

Predict the **action** taken using simulation parameters.

### 🧠 Models Used

* Logistic Regression
* Decision Tree Classifier
* Random Forest Classifier
* K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
* Support Vector Machine (SVM)

### 📏 Evaluation Metric

* Accuracy Score
